# Java Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of Java programming projects completed during the course "Grundlagen der Programmierung" (Introduction to Programming) at Humboldt University of Berlin.

Each project is placed in its own subfolder and includes:
- Source code in Java
- A short English-language README with instructions
- The original assignment sheet (in German)

## Contents

- **project-02-vollmond-und-flugsimulator**  
  Moon cycle simulation and airline overbooking analysis

- **project-03-sieb-und-game-of-life**  
  Sieve of Eratosthenes and Conway's Game of Life with graphics

- **project-04-armstrong-und-pythagoras**  
  Armstrong numbers and recursive tree drawing

- **project-05-maze-and-gray**  
  Maze solving with backtracking and Gray code conversion

- **project-06-number-systems-and-hamming**  
  Number base conversions and Hamming code implementation in TOY

- **project-07-euclidean-gcd**  
  Euclidean algorithm using subtraction

- **project-08-reverse-add-palindromes**  
  Reverse-and-add algorithm to detect non-palindromes

- **project-09-big-number-arithmetic**  
  Arithmetic on large integers using arrays of digits

## Purpose

These projects were built as part of the foundational programming curriculum and helped develop basic skills in:

- Java syntax and control structures
- Recursion and array manipulation
- File input and output
- Algorithmic thinking
- Low-level logic and simulation (TOY)

## Note

These projects were developed in 2022 during my early programming journey. They reflect my first structured experience writing Java code and applying fundamental computer science concepts in practice.
